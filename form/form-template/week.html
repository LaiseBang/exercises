    <h1>Input type="week"</h1>
    <p>This is a demonstration of <b>week</b> - before getting started,
        replace all references to <b>week</b> with the element you are
        demonstrating. And also rename the file! And change this text to be a
        short description of the <b>week</b></p>

    <form action="receiver.php">
        <!-- You probably have to add more attributes to the form -->
        <p>What week would you like to start?</p> <input type="week">

        <input type="submit"> <!-- and to the submit-button ... -->
    </form>
    <h2>Used for:</h2>
    <p>Creating input fields allowing to pick weeknumber in a year. In chrome and Opera you get a pop-up calender to
        select the date. In edge you get week and year pickers with sliding reels.</p>
    <h2>Important attributes:</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><code>size</code></dt>
        <dd> <b>input type="week"</b> doesn't support form sizing attributes such as size. You'll have to resort to CSS
            for sizing needs.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Typical child elements:</h2>
    <p><i>This element can't have children</i></p>
